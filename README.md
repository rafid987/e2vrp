# E2VRP

This repository contains codes for implementing metaheuiristic algorithms for solving two echelon vehicle routing problem.
## Data 
The data folder contains three data instances data file already formated for direct use. The original dataset can be found at "https://prolog.univie.ac.at/research/TwoEVRP/" .
## Algorithms
The e2vrp folder contains all neccessary files for implementing 4 metaheuristic algorithms - Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey wolf optimization & whale optimization algorithm.
## Test 
The results can be reproduced be using the three jupiter notebooks in the test folder. these jupiter notebooks can be directly run on google colab for testing the results. Just loading the notebook and running all will create the required results.
